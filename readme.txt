Easily add content anchors to your pages and posts

== Description ==

This plugin adds a unique ID attribute to healings in your page and post content, and then makes those anchors available in the linking pop-up. This makes it very easy to add "jump" links to headings within the content.

= Using the Plugin =
This plugin doesn't use any settings or require any setup, just activate it and it's features are available.

The plugin works by adding a unique "id" to the headings in your content. When you open your content for editing, the plugin adds unique ids to all the h2 and h3 headings. After saving the content, those headings become available as "anchors" which can be linked to.

To create an anchor link, add the desired link text, select it and click the "add link" icon. If you begin typing the heading you want the link to jump to, the anchor link for that heading will appear in the search results. Choose that anchor to place your link.

If you want a link from another page to jump to a heading, you can add the anchor link (begins with a "#") to the regular page link and when that link is clicked on the user will be taken to that heading on the new page.

For example, let's say you have a page at `https://your-website.co/making-a-link-list` that explains how to make a link list, and on that page is a tutorial with the heading "Tutorial" If you look at the HTML for that page, you'll see that the heading has an "id", like this" `<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>` On your other page you can link directly to that heading with an URL like this: `https://your-website.com/making-a-link-list#tutorial`
